Fuel
Metallica

Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh

Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red!

A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, war head
Fuck 'em, man
White knuckle tight
Through black and white

Ooh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean

Ooh
And then I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Yeah

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out hope
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah, oh, yeah!

Take the corner, going to crash
Headlights, headlines
Another junkie, lives too fast

Yeah, lives way too fast, fast, fast, ooh

Ooh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean

Ooh
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Oh, yeah

White knuckle tight

Ooh
Gimme fuel, gimme fire
My desire

Ooh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean

Ooh
And on and on
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Gimme fuel, gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh

On I burn
